1. Normal characters:   a-z, 0-9, _
2. rest all are special character

3. echo * => Here * charcter is given to echo command by shell and not echo cmd is taking * character

4. To disable speciality of special character:
      Backslash
      Single Quote : anything inside single quote is not treated as special character
      Double Quote : Only these two are considered as special character
                        $ - to access variables
                        ` - to execute command
                   : these two character speciality is negated by using \$ and \` 
                  
5. Filters (24:00) [-n we use to see line no.] [wc is to count no. of lines e.g. $wc -l messages]
     Line no. => Head - n 15 [By default, head cmd will give 1st 10 line o/p]
              => Tail -n 5   [By default, last 10 lines]
              => If we wish to get lines in between
                   e.g. $ cat -n \var\etc\messages | head -n 20 | tail -11   [to see o/p from line 10-20]
                   
     Row based =>
          We used grep command
                    grep word file [looking for 'word' in 'file']
                    
               => searching for multiple word in  single file
                    grep -e word1 -e word2 file  [searching for word 1 & word 2 in file]
                    grep -E 'word1|word2' passwd   [-E is extended grep] [if search character exceeds 256 then -E will not work]
                    
               => grep cmd is aliased with color 
                      "grep  --color=auto"
                      
               => -f (40:00 --)
                        we give all the words which we want to search in a file e.g. search.grep
                         then, $ grep -f search.grep passwd
                         
               => Searching single/mutiple word in mutiple files 
                    grep word file_name1 file_name2   [e.g. grep root /etc/passwd /etc/group]
                    we will get file_name1: o/p
                                file_name2: o/p
              
               
              Different options for grep cmd
                  -e option: Searching for word in file (e.g. grep -e root -e adm /etc/passwd)
                  -E option: Searching for word in file (e.g. grep -E 'root|adm' passwd)
                  -f option: Create a file with words we want to search (e.g. grep -f search.grep passwd)
                  -h option: When we dont want file_name and want only o/p then use (e.g. grep root /etc/passwd /etc/group -h)
                  -l option: When we want to print only list of file names which contain the word (e.g. grep root /etc/passwd /etc/group -l)
                  -c option: When we dont want to see the o/p and want just to know how many lines are there. (Instead of using wc -l cmd).
                  -i option: to disable case sensitivity
               => -w option: It will give complete line as o/p where the that particular word is there
               => -x option: It will give only particular word as o/p no other non-sense.
               => -A 1 option: It will give the next line also after the o/p
               => -B 1 option: Before one line
               
        wc option: It will give No. of lines, no. of words, no. of characters in that file
                 : e.g. wc /tmp/passwd
        wc -l option: to give no. of lines
        
        sort command: to sort based on option given
                    : -n ------ based on no.
                    : -n -r ----sort in reverse way
                    : | uniq ----to get unique value
                    : | uniq -d --to print only duplicates
                    
    
    
    /etc/passwd => File whch contain list of local user in the system
