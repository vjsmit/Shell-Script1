        - to see list of colors
        
(5) Redirectors:
      - If we want to replace i/p through a file and o/p to a file, we use redirectors
      - STDIN < If we want to take i/p from a file instead of a command line
      - STOUT >  
          STDOUT => 1>  (default)
          STDERR =>  2>   
          Both STDOUT & STDERR =>  &>
          To append the STDOUT =>  >>
          To print on screen & Saving it to other file => |tee <file_name>
          To print, save & append   =>                    |tee -a <file_name>
          Redirecting o/p in out file and if any error coming then append it with out =>     >out 2>&1
          Special location when we dont want to have o/p stored =>   >/dev/null
